## üß† Example Query

```sql
SELECT 
    pt.category, 
    pt.name, 
    SUM(od.quantity * p.price) AS revenue,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY pt.category ORDER BY SUM(od.quantity * p.price) DESC) AS rank_within_category
FROM 
    pizza_types pt
JOIN

    pizzas p ON pt.pizza_type_id = p.pizza_type_id
JOIN 
    orders_details od ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id

GROUP BY 
    pt.category, pt.name;
